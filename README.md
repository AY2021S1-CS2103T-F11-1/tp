#TAsker
##About
TAsker is a desktop application that seeks to help NUS CS TAs better manage their classes. Optimized for use via a 
Command Line Interface (CLI), users may track studentâ€™s submissions, consultation timings and grades, through the 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a structured manner. 

If you are interested in using TAsker, head over to the Quick Start section of the [User Guide](https://github.com/rnmy/tp/tree/master/docs/UserGuide.md) to find out more.
