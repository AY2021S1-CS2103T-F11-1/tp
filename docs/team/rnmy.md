## Project: TAsker

TAsker is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Enhancements to existing features**:
    
    - **Edit command**: Adapted the edit command to the new Person model which includes student specific fields such as their matriculation number and telegram handles which are pivotal to student administration.
          
    - **Attendance UI**: Added a new Attendance tabular pane to show the current attendance status of students.
    
    - **Improve error handling**: Added checks for all required fields before input validation and standardized the error message for inputs with valid command format but invalid index.
    
    - **Date validation**: Refined validation for attendance dates to detect dates such as 30/02/2020. 

    - **Unit tests**: Updated and wrote additional JUnit tests for existing features.
